Let me walk you through our return policy for such situations.\n\nIf you received a damaged item, we want to make things right as quickly as possible. Here’s what you need to do:\n\nReport the Issue: Please report the damage within 30 days of receiving your product. You can do this by contacting our customer support team via phone, email, or live chat, whichever is most convenient for you.\n\nProvide Details: We’ll need some information to process your return. Please provide your order number, a description of the damage, and photos of the damaged item and its packaging. This helps us assess the situation and prevent it from happening in the future.\n\nReturn or Exchange: Once we’ve reviewed your report, we’ll offer you two options:\n\nReplacement: We can send you a replacement item at no additional cost.\nRefund: If you prefer, we can issue a full refund, including any shipping fees you may have paid.\n\nReturn Shipping: In most cases, we’ll provide you with a prepaid return label if we need the damaged item back. You can use this label to send the item back to us at no cost to you. If the item is small and not worth returning, we might ask you to dispose of it instead.\n\nProcessing Time: After we receive the damaged item (if a return is needed) or confirm the damage from your photos, we’ll process the refund or ship the replacement within 3-5 business days. You’ll receive a confirmation email once this is done.\n\nTracking: If you choose a replacement, we’ll provide you with tracking information once it’s shipped so you can follow its progress.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need further assistance, please let me know. We’re here to help and want to make sure you’re fully satisfied with your purchase."
